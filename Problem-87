11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

CODE : -

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {

        int n = height.length;
        int i = 0, j = n-1;
        int max_area = 0;

        while(i<j){

            int w = j-i;
            int h;
            if(height[i]>height[j]){
                h = height[j];
            }
            else{
                h = height[i];
            }

            int area = h*w;

            if(max_area<area){
                max_area = area;
            }
            
            if(height[i]>height[j]){
                j--;
            }
            else{
                i++;
            }

        }

        return max_area;
        
    }
}
