860. Lemonade Change

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either 
a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

CODE : -

class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int length = bills.length;

        int r5 = 0, r10 =0;

        for(int i=0; i<length; i++){

            if(bills[i]==5){
                r5++;
            }

            else if(bills[i]==10){
                if(r5>0){
                    r5--;
                    r10++;
                }
                else{
                    return false;
                }
            }
            else{
                if(r5>0 && r10>0){
                    r5--;
                    r10--;
                }
                else if(r5>2){
                    r5 = r5-3;
                }
                else{
                    return false;
                }
            }

        }
        return true;

    }
}
