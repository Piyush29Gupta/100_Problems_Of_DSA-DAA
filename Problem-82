167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

CODE : -

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int size = numbers.length;
        int i = 0, j = size -1;
        int[] result = new int[2];
        
        while(i<j){
            if(numbers[i]+numbers[j] < target){
                i++;
            }
            else if(numbers[i]+numbers[j] > target){
                j--;
            }
            else{
                result[0] = i+1;
                result[1] = j+1;
                return result;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
